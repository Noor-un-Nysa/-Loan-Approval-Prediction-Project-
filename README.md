🚀 Loan Approval Prediction Project 🌟

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant data. It involves preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers.

🔧 Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset and dropped the identifier column.
Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features.
Transformed and created new features like TotalIncome, LogTotalIncome, and Loan-to-Income Ratio.
Encoded Loan_Status as binary values (1 for Approved, 0 for Rejected).
Modeling:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Trained Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
Evaluated models using accuracy and confusion matrices.
Results:

Visualized confusion matrices as heatmaps.
Compared model accuracies in a bar chart.
🪐 Technologies Used:

Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
💡 Goal:
To create a model that helps banks streamline the loan approval process by accurately predicting whether a loan will be approved or rejected.
